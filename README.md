# SportSee : physical coaching app

SportSee aims to develop a sports coaching application, which will track physical activity

## 1. General information

## 1.1 Technologies
- JS
- CSS in JS
- React

## 1.2 Contribute to the project

Sportsee is developed by the start-up sportsee

## 1.3 Authors

Our code squad : Laetitia Hars

## 2. Project

### 2.1 Prerequisites

- [NodeJS (**version 12.18**)](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

If you are working with several versions of NodeJS, we recommend you install [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). 
This tool will allow you to easily manage your NodeJS versions.

### 2.2 Launching the project

The front project uses a back. You can find the repo on github : https://github.com/OpenClassrooms-Student-Center/P9-front-end-dashboard

- Fork this repository
- Clone it on your computer.
- The `npm install` command will allow you to install the dependencies.
- The `npm start` command will allow you to run the project.
- Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view it in your browser.

The api currently only contains profile page data for users 12 and 18.
to access the profile page, go to 
- [http://localhost:3001/profil/12]
- [http://localhost:3001/profil/18]

## 3. Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
